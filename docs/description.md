# IntenseLogic

IntenseLogic is a general-purpose game engine designed with extensibility and performance in mind. It is designed from the ground up to be as extensible as possible without rebuilding the binary itself, and modules are as isolated as possible. It is not meant to compete with AAA game engines, especially in terms of features. 

We've spent nearly a year working on this engine, and have a few games in development. 

## Features

 * Lua scripting
 * OpenGL 3.1 rendering
 * Windows, Linux, and OS X support
 * Event system that allows any component to hook onto things that happen, and to fire events themselves
 * Focus on meaningful and helpful abstractions and utilities
 * Clean interface with lots of explicit state and pure functions

## Upcoming

 * Graphics API abstraction layer and GL 1.x support
 * Networking
 * Animation
